Using TypeScript and Next.js, I want to create an MPA (Multi-Page App) that will let me maintain a simple TO DO list.  The To Do items have simply a Description, Due Date, Priority (High, Medium, or Low) and a Status (Not Started, In Progress, Done, Canceled).   I want the app to load the To do Items from a DynamoDB database table that will have a Partition Key (PK) that is a UUID.  The UUID will need to be created when a new To Do Item is added by the user.    A User should be able to Add a To Do Item , Update a To Do Item (via an edit form), Delete a To Do Item, and the main page of the app should be a simple list of TOdo Items as a table with sortable columns.    Lastly, this is meant to be a simple, clean looking app.  If there are any errors connecting to the DYnamoDB database that information should be relayed to the user with a DETAILED ERROR MESSAGE.
